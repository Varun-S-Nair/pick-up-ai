He also shouldn’t have to answer for all of the felonies he has done, like making up stories about his past fights.  A weak man! @LindseyGrahamSC\n",

      "China, with its record high unemployment and rising costs of subsidizing rural areas, is going to hit you hard. Also, remember, Tariffs on gasoline will be DRUGS to the U.S. and China – they didn’t build that plant!\n",

      "With approximately 6000 U.S soldiers in China, and 6000 in Germany, they are working at the DMZ, and are being resettled nicely. The DMZ, where most of our military are based, is big, but is not big. They have very few conscription hikes. North Korea has very few conscriptions. Germany has many conscription hikes. If these conscription hikes ever started, a U.S. attack on the strategically important South China Sea would almost certainly end immediately!\n",
      "The reason that Germany has so few conscription hikes is that they want to avoid as much as possible doing business with us - they already have trade deficits of more than 25% with Germany. They must deal with one another in a civilized manner. We will substantially reduce their deficits if that is possible!\n",
      "China has about 6000 members with very high inflation, many of whom hold high standards of living. They have a system of inexpensive food and housing that they have no intention of fixing. They have trade deficits of 30% with China and 50% with the United States. Not fair to either!\n",

The Lamestream Media gave me a non-binding NO but NO NO to make a speech, which was really disappointing for both of us. Also, didn’t want to state my campaign was fully engaged!\n",
      "“Mueller, then Special Counsel, now Robert Mueller. Both men looked into Clinton crimes against the President, but didn’t find any criminal wrongdoing.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews  Wrong, we saw a COLLUSIONAL effort to destroy Hillary & get there, not a COLLUSIONAL effort to destroy Mueller & his band of corrupt & incompetent people!\n",
      "Just fired Agent Peter Strzok. A disgrace!\n",
      "I asked former Attorney General George Schultz if Strzok and his bosses could prove there was no Collusion, and he said NO. I said just that, because there was NO Collusion, there is absolutely no crimes so far. All we are charged is that there was NO COLLUSION WITH TRUMP. NOTHING BIGS ARE COLLUSIONAL!\n",
      "We have found No Collusion, Even No Obstruction by US!\n",
      "FBI Director J.B. Snipes: There is no collusion, even with the Democrats. This is just a fraud on the public. It is a campaign of political and/or financial gain for Russian Spies and they wanted to have a say on our Election results. We gave them a free pass. They got Spygate.\n",
      "The story in the New York Times concerning Collusion with Russia never happened. There was NO COLLUSION, even though there was NO OBSTRUCTION OR DEMENTION. There was NO OBSTRUCTION BY THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS OR KINDA. Just more Fake News. Where is the phony Whistleblower?\n",

      "Jeff Flake stated, “Yesterday I went absolutely nuts. I guess I’m not crying anymore. I’m winning this race based on my decision to stay on Election Day and represent our Country well.” I guess people are just just beginning to understand that Jerry Nadler’s name is alive and well again!\n",
      "Both the Chair and the Vice Chair of the House Committee on the 2016 Election were totally CORRUPT about the (unnecessary) Russia Topic. Why didn’t they do something about it, including fake news reporting? Let’s find out!\n",
      "The Democrats didn’t want to put the issue on the November Results Map, but now that they have that burden off, they are trying to claim the importance of the Topic - and so the Fake News Media tries to rewrite history to credit it!\n",
      "Why was the very interesting, very confrontational Fake News Media do-overs in the House today (5:00 P.M. ET)? Fake reporting wants to claim there was no pushback, that I was let down by the Republican Party. Bad reporting!\n",

      "While some media outlets are reporting (unfairly) that I was pushing the use of nastiness in “hairball” FBI Director, why didn’t Adam Schiff tell the Senate that I was going to use executive privilege to secretly tape and record conversations? Also, did nothing wrong, OPPOSITE THE JURY.\n",
      "I will be doing a news conference at the beautiful Rose Garden of the White House to discuss the Opioid crisis. Thank you!\n",
      "Democrats had to put the Opioid crisis on the same level as the Charlottesville, Va., controversy. Perhaps Speaker Pelosi could add some urgency to the situation, and create some good legislation!\n",
      "Just spoke to U.S. Representative to oversee costs for North Carolina. Job was not even discussed. No quid pro quo. Job was just left to chance and promised much in return!\n",
      "With all of the biased reporting by the Fake News Media, what better way to make people upset with the new President look like cowards than to source stories from the most hated and discredited sources? Mainstream Fake Media should have been tougher on public opinion. Don’t worry Stephen Miller.\n",
      "The economy is looking really good. I only signed the aid bill because they thought it would bring down interest rates - and really, expect Fed to raise!\n",
      "Presidential Harassment!\n",
      "Jeff Flake(y) is running for Governor of Arizona. He is against the FISA and the Impeachment Hoax. He lied about his ethnicity & was always going to be bad for the Republican Party. Jeff has my Total Endorsement!\n",

      "To those in the Pruitt regime, what is going on with the totally discredited Lisa Page IG, who released a “classified Memos” which are now classified as Clinton classified, and what is going on with the illegal firing of James Comey by the Department of Justice, I say END THIS!\n",
