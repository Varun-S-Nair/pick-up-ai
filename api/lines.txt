Was that an earthquake or did you just rock my world?

I can't believe I've been hear the entire evening with all these beautiful people and the moment I find 'The One', all I have time to say is "good bye".

I don't know if you're beautiful, I haven't gotten past your eyes yet.

Roses are red, I have a crush, whenever I‚Äôm around you, all I do is blush.

I‚Äôm no photographer but i can picture us together

I don't have a library card, but do you mind if I check you out?

Call me leaves cause you'll be falling for me soon

If you were a transformer, you'd be a HOT-obot, and your name would be Optimus Fine.

Did you sit in a pile of sugar? Cause you have a pretty sweet ass!

You know if you're being followed, the FBI wants to steal your penis. Will you help me find them?

I'd hide every chair in the world just so you'd have to sit on my face.

Is that a mirror in your pocket? 'Cause I can see myself in your pants.

If I had a dollar for every time I thought of you, I'd have $1, because you never leave my mind.

Girl, you're so hot, you make the equator look like the north pole.

I can't believe I've been hear the entire evening with all these beautiful people and the moment I find 'The One', all I have time

Are you cold? You look like you could use some hot chocolate... Well, here I am!

Your body is 65% water and I'm thirsty.

If I had a penny for every time I thought of you, I'd have exactly one cent, because you never leave my mind.

So, what do you do for a living besides always making all the men excited and warm all over?

I didn't see any stars in the sky tonight, the most heavenly body was standing right next to me.

You don't need keys to drive me crazy.

Are you a banana? Because I find you a-peeling

If your left leg was Christmas and your right was Thanksgiving, can I visit between the holidays?

I'm not a photographer, but I can picture me and you together.

If you were a tear in my eye I would not cry for fear of losing you.

If I had to choose between breathing or loving you, I would say "I love you" with my last breath!

I'm sorry, I don't think we've met. I wouldn't forget a pretty face like that.

If I had to choose between breathing or loving you, I would say "I love you" with my last breath!

Come live in my heart, and pay no rent.

Well, I AM telepathic, and I can tell that you love me. Right? [NO!] Darn, I always get "love" and "lust" mixed up.

You're so beautiful that you made me forget my pickup line.

You may fall from the sky, you may fall from a tree, but the best way to fall... is in love with me.

You are so beautiful that I would marry your brother just to get into your family.

I want to tell you your fortune. It's a simple one. You can read it here.

Hey... somebody farted. Let's get out of here.

You may be asked to leave soon, you're making all the other women look bad.

If you were a transformer, you'd be a HOT-obot, and your name would be Optimus Fine.

Did you sit in a pile of sugar? Cause you have a pretty sweet ass.

You know the more I drink, the prettier you get!

You're so hot you would make the devil sweat.

How much does a polar bear weigh? [How much?] Enough to break the ice... Hi, I'm (insert name here].

Of all the beautiful curves on your body, your smile is my favorite.

Pinch me. [Why?] You're so fine I must be dreaming.

If stars would fall everytime I would think of you, the sky would soon be empty.

If I had to choose between breathing or loving you, I would say "I love you" with my last breath!

You may fall from the
====================
Can I borrow a quarter? ["What for?"] I want to call my mom and tell her I just met the man/woman of my dreams.

If you were a booger I'd pick you first.

You know, Dr. Phil says I'm afraid of commitment...Want to help prove him wrong?

You may fall from the sky, you may fall from a tree, but the best way to fall... is in love with me.

Are you a beaver? Cause daaaaam!

I can't believe I've been hear the entire evening with all these beautiful people and the moment I find 'The One', all I have time to say is "good bye".

Are you a Snickers bar? Cause you satisfy me.

I'm sorry, I don't think we've met. I wouldn't forget a pretty face like that.

Your hand looks heavy. Let me hold it for you.

Are you a bank loan? Because I have a crippling amount of interest for you.

If I had to choose between breathing or loving you, I would say "I love you" with my last breath!

If I were a transplant surgeon, I'd give you my heart.

If beauty were time, you'd be eternity.

I'm sorry, I don't think we've met. I wouldn't forget a pretty face like that.

I must be dancing with the devil, because you're hot as hell.

Your body is a wonderland, and I'd like to be Alice.

If I had a penny for every time I thought of you, I'd have exactly one cent, because you never leave my mind.

I was so content with my life and one day I asked God, what could be better than this? And then I met you.

If your heart was a prison, I would like to be sentenced for life.

This isn't a beer belly, It's a fuel tank for a love machine.

Is your nickname Chapstick? Because you‚Äôre da balm!

You're kinda, sorta, basically, pretty much always on my mind.

If beauty were time, you'd be eternity.

Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears!

I seem to have lost my phone number. Can I have yours?

Were you arrested earlier? It's gotta be illegal to look that good.

Hey, don't I know you? Yeah, you're the girl with the beautiful smile.

Are you cold? You look like you could use some hot chocolate... Well, here I am!

Hey... Didn't I see your name in the dictionary under "Shazaam!"?

You're so hot, I bet you could light a candle at 10 paces.

Is your daddy a Baker? Because you've got some nice buns!

I can't believe I've been hear the entire evening with all these beautiful people and the moment I find 'The One', all I have time to say is "good bye".

Baby you're so sweet, you put Hershey's outta business.

Let's commit the perfect crime: I'll steal your heart, and you'll steal mine.

If you were a tropical fruit, you'd be a Fine-apple!

If you were a tear drop, I would never cry for fear of losing you.

Are you a campfire? Cause you are hot and I want s'more.

Is your name Dwayne Johnson? Because you Rock my world!

Let's commit the perfect crime: I'll steal your heart, and you'll steal mine.

Did you sit in a pile of sugar? Cause you have a pretty sweet ass.

You know, I would die happy if I saw you naked just once!

Wouldn't we look cute on a wedding cake together?

When I look into your eyes, it is like a gateway into the world of which I want to be a part.

You look so familiar... didn't we take a class together? I could've sworn we had chemistry.

I was so content with my life and one day I asked God, what could be better than this? And then I met you.

You are so beautiful that you give the sun a reason to shine.

You may fall from the sky, you may fall from a tree, but the best way to fall... is in love with me.

I'm sorry, I don't think we've met. I wouldn't forget a pretty face like that.

You are so beautiful that I would marry your brother just to get into your family.

I'm sorry, I don't think we've met. I wouldn
